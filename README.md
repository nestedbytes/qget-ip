# How to use
To use this you will need 2 things first one is a api which should be a web app which when visited should show the user's ip and the webpage should only have the text of the ip and nothing else.A api is already provided you can go with the deafult one.Second thing you need is a webhook url.So if you don't have a webhook you can host one using [Discord](https://discord.com) which is a chat app but it has the webhook feature.The deafult api will be in api.txt and the webhook url should be in webhook.txt
